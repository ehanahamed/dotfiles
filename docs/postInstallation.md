# Post installation setup

## Sound

Install `sof-firmware` & `alsa-firmware` (pacman)

Install `pulseaudio` (pacman)

I use ncpamixer, install `ncpamixer` (AUR)

Reboot before testing, so that changes are applied!

I didn't need to do any extra configuration, I just installed the packages and they work!
