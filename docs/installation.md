# Installing Arch

Disclaimer for annoying "LiNuX VeTErAnS"/"ArCh BaD GEnToo BetTeR" people: I use Arch because I like it. I don't think it's the best, most perfect distro, I don't think a perfect distro exists in the first place. If a perfect distro existed, then there would be no need for other distros to exist. I know Arch isn't the most DIY-distro, I know many so-called "liNUx-VeTERaNs" use Gentoo or make their own distro from scratch and think "aRcH iS FoR bABiEs". But, either way, I use Arch, so I'm making a guide for Arch. Also, just because I don't use a distro, like Debian or Gentoo, doesn't mean I don't like it, it just means I prefer Arch because it's my opinoin. I still think Gentoo and Debian are super cool, I just like using Arch. If you have a problem with that, don't read this.

Disclaimer for newbies: This guide is NOT for people who have never used Linux before. Arch requires a moderate amount of linux knowledge to install and use. If you're new to linux, I reccomend using Debian instead, it has it's own documentation and installer that explains how to install it, and is super easy!

## Preperation

You need
 - a USB drive
    - at least 2GB
 - modern UEFI firmware
    - this guide is not made for legacy, non-UEFI firmware, I do not know how those work.
    - I have an HP Pavilion, so my HP UEFI might look a little different from yours, but most stuff will be similar.
 - a compatible computer
    - at least 20GB storage
    - at least 2GB RAM
    - x86_64 cpu
 - basic linux shell knowledge
    - (COPYING COMMANDS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THEM CAN HARM YOUR COMPUTER!!!)
 - basic understanding of how software, files, operating systems, and partitions work
    - (DOING STUFF DETAILED HERE WITHOUT PROPER UNDERSTANDING CAN HAMR YOUR COMPUTER!!!)
 - enough time
    - (you won't be able to use anything on your computer while installing Arch)
 - and also
    - luck
    - skill
    - concentrated power of will

**The current day is Friday, May 5th, 2023. THIS GUIDE WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK 5 OR 6 MONTHS AFTER MAY 2023, because Arch is a constantly changing distro. DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE IF MAY 2023 WAS MORE THAN 5 OR 6 MONTHS AGO!**

**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU BREAKING YOUR COMPUTER BY FOLLOWING THIS GUIDE INCORRECTLY.**
